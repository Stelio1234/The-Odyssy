      <p>This song connects to the story, when Odysseus and some of his crew went to invstigate to see if Polyphemus
        (The cyclops name)
        was friend or foe. The song tells about how they found the cave and made Polyphemus angry.
        The how Odysseus offerd him wine in extange that they get to stay alive. The song in general discribes alot of

        <p>Cyclops, try some wine.
          Here’s liquor to wash down your scraps of men.
          Taste it, and see the kind of drink we carried
          under our planks. I meant it for an offering
          if you would help us home. But you are mad,
          unbearable, a bloody monster! After this,
          will any other traveler come to see you?’‘Cyclops,
          you ask my honorable name? Remember
          the gift you promised me, and I shall tell you.
          My name is Nohbdy: mother, father, and friends,
          everyone calls me Nohbdy.’</p>
